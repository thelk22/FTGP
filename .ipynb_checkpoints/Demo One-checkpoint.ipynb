    "NB: Please note that the main aim behind this particular Jupyter notebook is not to use this editor as your primary IDE but to demonstrate to you some of the programming techniques and key knowledge that you might have acquired from previous modules.\n",

    "## What is required?\n",
    "In this demonstration, you are expected to go through the cells and understand what each code means. You are encouraged to develop your own methods of redoing these codes and try to implement new ways of doing similar tasks. Actually, this would be the main aim of the Tutorial/Lab sessions! In the Tutorial, you will be expected to have read and discuss this document in order to be able to solve the tutorial questions. \n",

    "### What is byte?\n",
    "Byte, the basic unit of information in computer storage and processing. A byte consists of 8 adjacent binary digits (bits), each of which consists of a 0 or 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For numeric data, one byte holds a binary number from 0 to 255. This is a modern de facto standard of eight bits as documented by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be easly observed by simply knowing the rules of probability and statstics. For example, knowing how to answer how many outcomes exists if we toss a coin twice: TT, HH, TH, HT. This means that there are 4 outcomes or $2^2$. Since each observation has 2 sets of outcomes H or T. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "The number of bytes of storage occupied by a single character depends on the character encoding you are using. A programming language might support one or two encodings, or might support a wide variety of character encodings. Likewise, an operating system, file system, etc. may support one or two encodings, or might support a wide variety of encodings. The number of bytes used for each character limits the number of unique characters that can be represented.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python ships with the standard stash of popular hash functions $hash(x)=f(x)$; they are available in the hashlib library. Python hashlib hashing function takes variable length of bytes and converts it into a fixed length sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an essential step to understand PoW algorithm. In particular, there are many cryptographic hash functions available in this library. The most well-known cryptographic set of hash functions is the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (a.k.a SHA-2). Designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA),  SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one we shall be using in this demonstration is the SHA256 algorithm that generates an almost unique, fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Bitcoin uses double iterated SHA-256, or SHA-256(SHA-256()), also known as sha256d in most algorithm listings. Ethereum uses Keccak-256 in a consensus engine called [Ethash](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Ethash). Keccak is a family of hash functions that eventually got standardized to SHA-3 (SHA256 is part of a family of hash functions called SHA-2). Ethereum called it Keccak instead of SHA-3 as it has slightly different parameters than the current SHA-3. Colloquially, Ethereum mining is never called Keccak mining because Ethash utilizes mixhashes in a DAG, which is different from Hashcash proof-of-work.\n",

    "* How can I decrypt SHA-256?\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can't! SHA-256 is NOT an encryption algorithm! A lot of people are under the impression that SHA-256 encrypts data. It does no such thing. All it does is compute a hash value for a given set of data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* How do I reverse SHA-256?\n",
    " \n",
    "     You can't! SHA-256 is NOT reversible. Hash functions are used as one-way methods. They take the data (messages) and compute hash values (digests). The inverse can't be done.\n",

    "### What is Unicode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is an industry standard for consistent encoding of written text. Its aim is to provide a unique number to identify every character for every language, on any platform! \n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode maps every character to a specific code, called **code point**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode defines different characters encodings, the most used ones being UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. UTF-8 is definitely the most popular encoding in the Unicode family, especially on the Web. Currently there are more than 135.000 different characters implemented, with space for more than 1.1 millions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### But how many bytes is this string ```Rami```?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, it depends on the encoding method used. It is important to note that using the ASCII values, each 1 byte may hold 1 character! See this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21300929/how-many-characters-can-you-store-with-1-byte) for futher details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, ```chr()``` method returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is an integer. Unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8, the dominant encoding on the World Wide Web (used in over 95% of websites as of 2020, and up to 100% for some languages) and on most Unix-like operating systems, uses one byte (8 bits) for the first 128 code points, and up to 4 bytes for other characters.The first 128 Unicode code points represent the ASCII characters, which means that any **ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text**.

    "### What is a genesis block?\n",
    "A Genesis Block is the name given to the first block a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, ever mined.\n",
    "\n",
    "When our Blockchain is instantiated, we’ll need to seed it with a genesis block—a block with no predecessors and an index of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is nonce?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonce is an attribute of a block. A nonce is an abbreviation for \"**number only used once**,\" which is a number added to a hashed—or encrypted—block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. The nonce is the number that blockchain miners are solving for, in order to receive cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: It is important to distinguish between nonce header of a block (the one we are refering to above) and nonce is the number of transactions sent from a given address in Ethereum blockchain. These links [1](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/72042/what-is-the-difference-between-account-nonce-and-block-nonce) and [2](https://www.quora.com/What-is-nonce-in-Ethereum-Is-it-different-from-nonce-in-Bitcoin) will explain the difference and therefore please do not mix these two different definitions with one another! If you would like to know more about the nonce as a number of transactions see this [link](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-nonce/)."
